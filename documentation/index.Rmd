# Project RoboCar

We want to build autonomous driving model cars which can master a course without any human intervention

The project was started during one of those cold dark winter evenings on 8th of February 2018 by

- Elias, who carried this idea with him for quite some time already
- Andreas, who as far as I can tell is interested in just about everything
- Finn, who probably never thought about this idea before that day but was immediately enthusiastic 
- Uwe, who was infected with the idea by Elias in autumn 2017

We decided then and there to build autonomous robotic cars probably with Raspberry Pi, but open for all possible concepts.

We organize our meetings via the meetup group https://www.meetup.com/Esslingen-Makerspace/, you are welcome to join in, register as a member of that meetup group and you will receive invitations to our meetings.


This documentation shall act as an archive for 

-	[Resources]
-	[Experiences gathered]
- [Theory]
-	[Minutes of meeting]
